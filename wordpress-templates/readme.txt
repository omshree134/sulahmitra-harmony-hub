## How to Use These Templates in WordPress

### Method 1: Using the Block Editor (Gutenberg)

2. Choose "Code Editor" view instead of "Visual Editor"
3. Copy and paste the HTML from the corresponding template file
4. For header and footer, use either:
   - A WordPress theme that allows custom header/footer code
   - A plugin like "Header Footer Code Manager"

### Method 2: Using Elementor

1. Install and activate the Elementor plugin
2. Create a new page for each template
3. Edit with Elementor
4. Add an "HTML" widget
5. Copy and paste the HTML from the corresponding template file
6. For styling, you can either:
   - Copy the CSS from the template file into the Elementor > Site Settings > Custom CSS
   - Or use the Elementor styling options to recreate the styles

### Method 3: Using Divi

1. Install and activate the Divi theme/plugin
2. Create a new page for each template
3. Enable the Divi Builder
4. Add a "Code" module
5. Copy and paste the HTML from the corresponding template file
6. Add the CSS to Divi > Theme Options > Custom CSS

## Customization Tips

1. **Colors**: The templates use a dark theme with accent colors. You can adjust these colors by modifying the CSS variables or directly changing the color values.

2. **Images**: Replace image placeholders with your own images by uploading them to the WordPress Media Library and updating the image URLs.

3. **Forms**: The contact form is provided as HTML but will need to be replaced by a WordPress form plugin like Contact Form 7, WPForms, or Gravity Forms.

4. **Navigation**: Update the navigation links to match your WordPress page structure.

5. **Fonts**: The templates use Google Fonts (Inter and Playfair Display). These are loaded via link tags in the header.html file.

## Responsive Design

These templates are designed to be fully responsive. The layout will adjust for different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
